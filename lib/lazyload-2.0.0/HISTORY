LazyLoad Changelog
================================================================================

Version 2.0.0 (2009-08-06)
  * Added support for CSS. Caveat: Gecko and WebKit don't support the onload
    event	for link nodes, so the CSS callback will fire almost immediately in
    those browsers.
  * When an array of URLs is specified, the resources will be loaded in parallel
    in browsers that support it. Currently, all browsers support loading CSS in
    parallel, but only Gecko and Opera support parallel scripts while preserving
		execution order. 
  * The load() method has been replaced by css() and js() methods for loading
    CSS and JS, respectively.
  * The loadOnce() method has been removed, since it wasn't terribly useful.
  * Improved reliability in all supported browsers.

Version 1.0.4 (2008-07-24)
  * Improved reliability with all supported browsers.
  * Reduced the minified size to 1751 bytes (a whopping 67 bytes smaller than
    version 1.0.3).
  * Fixed a bug that caused the load completion callback to fire immediately in
    Safari 3.x.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the load completion callback to fail to fire in
    Internet Explorer if the script was loaded from the cache.

Version 1.0.3 (2007-06-18)
  * Added "force" parameter to the loadOnce() method to force execution of the
    callback even when all specified scripts have already been loaded.

Version 1.0.2 (2007-06-02)
  * Improved browser detection.
  * Switched to NaturalDocs for source documentation.

Version 1.0.1 (2007-05-30)
  * Fixed potential race condition when load() is called multiple times in
    succession.
  * Refactored to reduce complexity.

Version 1.0.0 (2007-05-29)
  * First release.
